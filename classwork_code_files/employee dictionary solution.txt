Suppose we have list of employees, we have the employee name and salary
let the user enter their data and fill it in a dictionary then do following:
1. Find and print the name of the employee who has the highest salary
2. Find and print the name and salary of the employee who gets the lowest salary
3. Enter an employee name and print out his/her salary and names of employees who are having a similar salary, but if the employee not found, print a messages says that, or if no employees have the same salary print a message says that
4. Let the user enter an employee name, if found then find and print out the amount of tax which is 15% of the salary for salaries less than 5000 and 20% for others.
5. Find and print the average of all salaries

at the beginning of the program show a menu to the user including all the 5 requirements
so the user can choose any of them or 0 to exit

The menu:
0. Exit
1. The employee of the highest salary
2. The employee name and salary of lowest salary
3. Employees of similar salary of given name
4. Tax for a given employee
5. Average of all salaries

Choose your option:
