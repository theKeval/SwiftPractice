Create a Swift program to do following:

Suppose we have a collection of employees 
Let the user enter the employee name and monthly salary for each
And let the user choose the rank of the employee from 1 to 3
We need to find out the net monthly salary of each as it 
equals monthly salary - monthly tax + monthly bonus
bonus is 10% of the monthly salary for rank 1 and 7% for rank 2 and 3% for rank 3
tax is 24% of the monthly salary if the annual salary is 85K+
and tax is 19% of the monthly salary if the annual salary is 65K+
and tax is 13% of the monthly salary if the annual salary is 50K+ 
and no tax if the annual salary less than 50K

We need to let the user enter name and monthly salary of an employee
then print out the name and the net monthly salary then ask the user
do you have more employees? yes/no, then if yes repeat if no stop

Try to use functions as needed and don't forget to put enough comments
