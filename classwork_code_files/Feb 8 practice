Create 2 empty arrays
first array of products name and the second of products prices
Let the user enter as many as they want of products to fill both arrays

Then let the user enter a product name
search if it's found then show its price, or a message says it doesn't exist
if the product is found and show its price then ask the user to enter the required quantity to buy.
Then find the total and add 13% for tax then ask the user if wants to buy more products.
If yes repeat and add the total to grand total. 
if the user doesn't want to buy any more products then show the grand total and stop.

create a function for reading and filling the both arrays
func fillData(names :[String], prices: [Double])
{
 ........ you have to find how to stop reading and filling
}

create a function to get the name of the product and return its price or -1 if not exist
func getPrice(name: String) -> Double
{
 .........
}

var granTotal = 0.0

suppose the price is 17.5 and the quantity is 3
total = 17.5 * 3 * 1.13
grandTotal += total
